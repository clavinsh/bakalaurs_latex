    abstract = {In this work, the emphasis is on the development of strategies
                to realize techniques of numerical computing on the graphics
                chip. In particular, the focus is on the acceleration of
                techniques for solving sets of algebraic equations as they occur
                in numerical simulation. We introduce a framework for the
                implementation of linear algebra operators on programmable
                graphics processors (GPUs), thus providing the building blocks
                for the design of more complex numerical algorithms. In
                particular, we propose a stream model for arithmetic operations
                on vectors and matrices that exploits the intrinsic parallelism
                and efficient communication on modern GPUs. Besides performance
                gains due to improved numerical computations, graphics algorithms
                benefit from this model in that the transfer of computation
                results to the graphics processor for display is avoided. We
                demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by implementing
                direct solvers for sparse matrices, and by applying these solvers
                to multi-dimensional finite difference equations, i.e. the 2D
                wave equation and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.},

    abstract = {Benchmarking is a widely used method in experimental computer
                science, in particular, for the comparative evaluation of tools
                and algorithms. As a consequence, a number of questions need to
                be answered in order to ensure proper benchmarking, resource
                measurement, and presentation of results, all of which is
                essential for researchers, tool developers, and users, as well as
                for tool competitions. We identify a set of requirements that are
                indispensable for reliable benchmarking and resource measurement
                of time and memory usage of automatic solvers, verifiers, and
                similar tools, and discuss limitations of existing methods and
                benchmarking tools. Fulfilling these requirements in a
                benchmarking framework can (on Linux systems) currently only be
                done by using the cgroup and namespace features of the kernel. We
                developed BenchExec, a ready-to-use, tool-independent, and
                open-source implementation of a benchmarking framework that
                fulfills all presented requirements, making reliable benchmarking
                and resource measurement easy. Our framework is able to work with
                a wide range of different tools, has proven its reliability and
                usefulness in the International Competition on Software
                Verification, and is used by several research groups worldwide to
                ensure reliable benchmarking. Finally, we present guidelines on
                how to present measurement results in a scientifically valid and
                comprehensible way.},
